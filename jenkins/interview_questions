Simply copy the jenkins home directory or use aws ebs(Any network strorage, create snapshots out of it and move to another server)

2. How to restore the Deleted job

3. How to take backup of the jenkins
Generally just copy the JENKINS_HOME diretory for copy, we can use ThinBackup pulgin to do the backup

To move the jenkins_home directory to another path and create the symlink (We can also use AWS EBS and mount)

  1.Shutdown you Jenkins.
  Move all files from /var/lib/jenkins to /app/jenkins

  2. mv /var/lib/jenkins /app/
  Replace /var/lib/jenkins with a symbolic link to /app/jenkins

  3. ln -s /app/jenkins /var/lib/jenkins
  Start Jenkins again.

  That way all the files are actually stored under /app but all paths to /var/lib/jenkins stay valid due to the symbolic link.

4. GitHUb webhook and what is application/json in it
