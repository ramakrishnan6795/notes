Points:
  1. We cannot access secrets and Configmaps in pods which was created in diffrent namespace. These are namespace scoped. The scerets and configmaps can be accessed only by
  resources within the same namespace
  2. Eventhough if we map ClusterRole with RoleBinding still it will be namespace scoped of RoleBinding namespace.
