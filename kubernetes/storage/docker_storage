Storage in Docker:
  --> Storage drivers
  --> Volume Drivers(plugins)

STORAGE DRIVERS (File system)
docker stores their files in
/var/lib/docker/
    aufs/
    containers/
    image/
    volumes/
   
Volume Mounting - Mouting the docker volume to container
Bind Mounting - Mounting the folder from host to container

Storage drivers are responsible for this layered architecture, creating a writable layer, moving files across layers(copying, writing)
AUFS, ZFS, BTRFS, Device Mapper, overlay, overlay2

The selcetion of storage drivers depends on the underlying operating system
With ubuntu the default storage driver is AUFS
