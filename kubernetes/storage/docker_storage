Storage in Docker:
  --> Storage drivers
  --> Volume Drivers(plugins)

STORAGE DRIVERS (File system)
  docker stores their files in
  /var/lib/docker/
      aufs/
      containers/
      image/
      volumes/

  Volume Mounting - Mouting the docker volume to container
  Bind Mounting - Mounting the folder from host to container

  Storage drivers are responsible for this layered architecture, creating a writable layer, moving files across layers(copying, writing)
  AUFS, ZFS, BTRFS, Device Mapper, overlay, overlay2

  The selcetion of storage drivers depends on the underlying operating system
  With ubuntu the default storage driver is AUFS
  
Volume Drivers
  Volumes(Volume Mounting, Bind Mounting) are not handled by storage drivers. The default volume driver plugin is "Local" which help in createig the volume in docker host and stores it in /var/lib/docker/volumes directory.
  There are many other volume driver plugins that allow you to create a volume on third party solutions like Azure File Storage, Convoy, Digital ocean block storage, Flocker, gce-docker,
  GlusterFs, Netapp, RexRay, Portwork, Vmware vSphere storage
  
  RexRay can be used to provision the storage in AWS EBS, Google persistet disk, openstack cinder
  
  while creating the docker container we can provide the volume-driver parameter as
  doker run -it --name mysql --volume-driver rexray/ebs --mount src=ebs-vol,dest=/var/lib/mysql mysql (This will create a container and attach a volume from AWS cloud)
  Even now if the container exists, the data is safe in was cloud
