Switching Basics: (Switches are used to transfer the packets only within the network)
1. To check the the interface name:
  ip link
  
2. To assign ip address to machine
  ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0    (This will not persist across reboot, To do this add in /etc/networks file)
  
ROUTER (Helps to connect two different networks. It is a server with many network ports)
  Router will get one IP from each network
  
GATEWAY(Route): (It is part of one network)
1. To see Existing routing configuration
  route or ip route
  
2. You have two networks with 2 systems each (A,B) and (C,D). To connect this two network we used Router. Then system B to reach system C in another network,
we have to add the subnet to the route table to point to the gateway
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1

3. To route to internet
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1  OR ip route add 0.0.0.0 via 192.168.1.1
ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0 in gateway section means no gateway) Gateway is not required, since it is local network the packets will be transferred within
the same network

4. If you have two router one for private and one for public(Internet). The network will assign one Ip to each router like this privae(192.168.1.1) and public(192.168.1.2)
To route to other internal network
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1

To route to Internet
ip route add 0.0.0.0 via 192.168.1.2

5. How to setup linux host as a Router
We have three system A,B,C A and B connected to one network 192.169.1.0 and B and C to one network as 192.168.2.0 The system B is conneted to two networks using two Interface(eth0, eth1)
If we ping C from A, it wont work, there is no routing specified . After adding the route still it wont work, because by default in linux the packets are not transferred from one
interface eth0 to other interface eth1 in same system.
This is for security purpose, lets say if the eth0 is private network and eth1 is punlic network, it should not transfer packets between this interfaces
But in this case we know both are private network We change the update the filr to value 1 in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  By default it will be 0 means no forward
This will not persists across reboots, To acheive this add in this file /etc/sysctl.conf
...
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
...
