1. To list all branches from local nd remote
  git branch -a
  
2. To list local branches
  git branch
  
3. To list remote branches
  git branch -r
  
4. To create branch
  git branch new_branch_name current_branch_name (if current_branch_name is not passed it will automatically take the current branch name)
  
5. To change branch
  git checkout branch_name
  
6. To create branch and checkout to that branch
  git checkout -b new_branch_name (This will fail, if we pass existing branch name)
  
7. To delete a local branch
  git branch -d branch_name (For deleting a branch, we should change to other branch first)
  --> The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch.
  --> Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet.
