1. To list all branches from local nd remote
  git branch -a
  
2. To list local branches
  git branch
  
3. To list remote branches
  git branch -r
  
4. To create branch
  git branch new_branch_name current_branch_name (if current_branch_name is not passed it will automatically take the current branch name)
  
5. To change branch
  git checkout branch_name
  
6. To create branch and checkout to that branch
  git checkout -b new_branch_name (This will fail, if we pass existing branch name)
  
7. To delete a local branch
  git branch -d branch_name (For deleting a branch, we should change to other branch first)
  --> The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch.
  --> Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet.
  
8. To see the diff between braches before merging
  git diff current_branch_name merging_branching_name
  
9. To merge branch (by default Fast-Forward)
  git merge merging_branch_name  (1. Change to the main branch and run the command 2. After merging we can delete that branch)
  Fast-Forward --> Merges all commits from the merging branch into the current merge with exact commit log message (If 3 commits are happend in merging_branch then after merging 
  these 3 commits will be shown in current branch)
  
10. Disabling Fast-Forward merge
  git merge merging_branch_name --no-ff (Then we can delete that branch)
  No Fast-Forward --> Merges all commits from the merging branch into the current merge with exact commit log message (If 3 commits are happend in merging_branch then after merging 
  these 3 commits will be shown in current branch) + (one more commit with messaage "merge merging_branch_name to current_branch_name").
  The merging_branch will be preserved (we can see in git log --decorate --graph --oneline)
  
11. (Also called as Automatic Merge)If we create new branch and created 3 commits and also in the main branch 2 commits are happend. Now if you switch to main branch and run "git merge merging_branch_name"
    by default Fast-Forward will be disabled
