Object Oriented Programming:
  It is about: Class, Object, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Data Abstraction and Data Encapsulation.
  Each objet could be anything which exists in real-time, Each objects has characteristics and functions.
    Charateristics --> name, age (variables)
    Functions
    
  why oops? --> to group related functions, To create template/blue print
  Inside the class the functions are clalled as methods and the methods will have first parameter "self"
