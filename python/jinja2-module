Python Jinja module
Jinja is a template engine for Python. It is similar to the Django template engine.
 
A template engine or template processor is a library designed to combine templates with a data model to produce documents. Template engines are often used to generate large
amounts of emails, in source code preprocessing, or producing dynamic HTML pages.

We create a template engine, where we define static parts and dynamic parts. The dynamic parts are later replaced with data. The rendering function later combines the templates with data.

Jinja installation
$ sudo pip3 install jinja2
We use the pip3 tool to install Jinja.

Jinja delimiters
Jinja uses various delimiters in the template strings.

{% %} - statements
{{ }} - expressions to print to the template output
{# #} - comments which are not included in the template output
# ## - line statements
