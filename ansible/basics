1. Dependency for using Ansible.
Python should be installed in both ansible host and also in all target servers

2. Where the default ansible configuration file and host/inventory file is located
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

3. How ansible will find the ansible configurations
Ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG, ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in the home directory, or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
finds first

4. Nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook or with command line flags.

5. To list all options of ansible
ansible-config list

6. Executing the ansible module using command-line
ansible host_name/group_name -m ping -i inventory.txt

7. Host key checking can be disbaled/enabled by the following ways
By default host_key_checking is enabled
In ansible.cfg --> host_key_checking = False
In inventory file --> ansible_ssh_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_port=2222 ansible_ssh_host=127.0.0.1 host_key_checking=false
In ansible.cfg --> ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
As environment variable --> export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False  (This might not work on newer ansible versions)
