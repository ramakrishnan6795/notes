IMPORTANT: Use aws_ec2 plugin instead of this steps

To use aws ec2 dynamic inventory, we have to download the ec2.py, ec2.ini from the anisble github repo to our ansible host machine  
To run this python scripy we need one dependency module to be installed boto or boto3 (which is python module for aws)
sudo pip install boto

Next, for aws account credentials, if our ansible host also in aws ec2 then we can use the IAM role for authentication or else we have to configure the credentials in
the server manually by exporting aws ACCESS_ID and AWS_SECRET_ID as environment variable or put in ~/.boto fileansible 
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK123'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='abc123'

Then if we run the ec2.py it will return the josn data will lost of detials about the ec2-servers,
The ec2 group will have all the ips in that account, and many more group are there in that json based on instance_type, ami_id, ec2_region etc...

ansible -i ec2.py ec2 -m ping 
Here -i ec2.py --> is the custom inventory script available from ansible
ec2 --> is the group name avilable in the json data returned from ec2.py

If we want custom group name, we have to craete our own python script for ec2
